Extremely silly OpenFrameworks app that permits to show several videos, which can be fired by keyboard keys or UDP received messages.

It is based on an XML file (located at bin/data), with the following structure:

<port>10552</port>						Specifies the port to which messages are being sent (IP is assumed local)
<movies>								List of movies
	<movie>
		<baseline>true</baseline>		Baseline movie: this movie loops forever, and when other movies end, this 										movie is again played.
		<name>movies/movie1.mpg</name>	Name and location of the movie.
		<event>d1</event>				Received UDP message that fires this movie.
		<key>1</key>					Mapped key that permits to fire this movie aswell.
	</movie>
	<movie>								In this case, this movie falls back to baseline=false.
		<name>movies/movie2.mpg</name>
		<event>d2</event>
		<key>2</key>
	</movie>
	...
</movies>

OpenFrameworks version used is 0071.
Used addons (although they are already included as local copies):
	- ofxNetwork
	- ofxXmlSettings



NOTE:
This project is part of a three-apps project I developed for a friend's birthday party. See the UDPSender README for further details.
